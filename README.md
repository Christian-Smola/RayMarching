# RayTracing
#### Description
In this project, I explore advanced rendering techniques such as ray tracing and ray marching. At first glance the scene may seem quite simple but it's important to realize that the scenes are being procedurally generated at runtime using HLSL. This project has been subdivided into sections, each of which is dedicated to a specific technique. All the resources I've used for this project are referenced at the top of the corresponding script or function.
